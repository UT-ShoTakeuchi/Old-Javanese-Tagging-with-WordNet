This project aims at building an automated tagger of Old Javanese text using Wordnet created by David and Zakariya (2020). Currently (2024-05-17) using Python in Google Colab environment. Example Old Javanese text shown in the project is from Zurbuchen (1976).

The development of the program has just started, and it must be stated that it lacks the ability of basic Morpheme Analysis, thus being mostly erroneous. In addition, the Wordnet itself is also small compared to the Old Javanese-English Dictionary by Zoetmulder and Robson (1982), so the expansion must also take place somewhere.
